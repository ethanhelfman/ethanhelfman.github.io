## Intro

Iron Reign has been an active robotics team for the past eight years. We have competed in FLL, Google
Lunar X Prize Challenge, and now, First Tech Challenge (FTC).

While our team originated at WB Travis Vanguard and Academy, since our members became older (such
is the passage of time), we are now hosted by the School of Science and Engineering at Townview (SEM),
in DISD. Despite our school being 66% economically disadvantaged and being Title 1, our school
consistently ranks in the top 10 nationwide academically. Our school also has numerous other award-
winning extracurricular clubs; including CX Debate, Math/Science UIL, and more. Our school employs a
rigorous STEM-based curriculum, which provides our students access to specialized class schedules, such
as Engineering, Computer Science, and Math, as well as paying for AP classes that our students would
normally not be able to afford. The average SEM student takes at least 10 APs.

## A History of Iron Reign

Iron Reign has been a team for eight years. We initially started as a First Lego League (FLL) team,
plateauing in regionals every year we competed. This was usually not due to the actual “robot game” in
FLL, but due to our presentations to the theme. Starting there, Iron Reign was defined as focusing on
creativity and innovative designs. We also did Google’s Lunar X Prize program every summer, achieving
finalist status in 2011 and 2012. Upon moving to high school, we started doing FTC, as FRC was too cost-
prohibitive to be parent-run.

We have been an FTC team for 6 years, advancing further and further each year. Last year, we got to the
South Super Regionals, qualifying by winning the North Texas Inspire Award, which means that we cover
all parts of the competition, from teamwork, to the presentation, to creativity, and to the actual game.
In Georgia, the same year, we were the first alternative for Worlds if another team dropped out.

Also in FTC, we compete in the Texas UIL State Championships. For those unfamiliar with UIL, it is the
main organizational committee for all public school academic and athletic events in the state of Texas.
Through UIL, we helped compete in the first test program for the UIL Robotics program and since then
have competed in every subsequent tournament.

## Outreach

Our outreach stands out from other teams through our mode of presentation. Last year, we renovated a
90’s Seaview Skyline RV, took out the “home” components, such as the bathroom and bedroom, and
turned it into a mobile tech lab, so that we can bring STEM to underprivileged demographics within our
community. Our RV currently holds 4 3D Printers, 30+ computers, 3 widescreen TVs, and 1 microwave.
Our current curriculum consists of teaching kids 3D modelling in the back of the RV, using Google
Sketchup, as it is free and available to any family with a computer. We usually help them design
keychains, as they are memorable, but don’t take excessive time to print on our printers. In the front,
we teach kids how to use EV3 robots and teach them how to use the EV3 programming language to 
compete in a sumo-bot competition. We also give advice to parents and educators on how to start FIRST
teams.

To make Iron Reign’s history entirely clear, we **built** the RV last year. We do not claim any credit for the
actual construction of the RV; however, the goal of this year was to make our Mobile Learning Lab run
year round, make it sustainable, and expand the programs to more communities around the nation. We
have done all of this.

To fill and staff the RV, we have received grants from Best Buy to purchase the 3D printers and laptops,
grants from non-profits such as BigThought and Dallas City of Learning to fund the building and upkeep
of the RV, and staffing from BigThought and AmeriCorps, as well as our own team. The AmeriCorps
staffing is especially notable, as it is a US Federal Government program to support civil service within
communities. Over the summer, several of our team members became officially employed by Americorp
to staff the RV full-time.

When not in outreach service, we can transform our RV into tournament mode. We have taken
numerous long-distance road trips aboard our RV, with locations such as Austin, Arkansas, Oklahoma,
and Florida. We substitute the laptops for a band saw and drill press, use the flat screens to program
instead of teach, and bring our higher-quality personal 3D printer. At tournaments, we encourage other
teams to board our RV, not only to encourage them to start their own similar programs, but also to help
them with mechanical and building issues.

Iron Reign spends a large amount of time on outreach. This year alone, we have put in 680 man-hours
and created 4300 individual connections to people in our community. Our goal of this outreach is to
reach disadvantaged children who would not normally have the opportunity to participate in STEM
programs in order to spark their interest in STEM for future learning. Some of our major outreach events
include presenting at the National Science Teachers’ Association Convention in Florida, hoping to inspire
people in other regions to adopt our methods of outreach. We volunteered at a Microsoft youth
convention to spread STEM awareness, as well as volunteering throughout our school district.

We also volunteer for FIRST. We have hosted a scrimmage for our entire school district, DISD (one of the
largest school districts in the country), and have hosted a qualifier for the North Texas region in
December. This qualifier had 26 teams, and we managed 30+ volunteers. We also did the entire setup
and tear-down. We also instruct parents and educators on how to start a FIRST team when volunteering,
as Iron Reign itself was started by parents at WB Travis.

_Update (10 November 2017):_

_The Mobile Tech Experience program described above received a grant from Best Buy for its outstanding
performance, and to fund more outreach events and upkeep of the MXP. The company that schedules
MXP deployments, BigThought, also signed onto a year-round deployment schedule for the MXP._

_Update #2 (22 March 2018)_

_BigThought, our programmatic sponsor for the Mobile Learning Lab, is helping educators and
professionals in five cities across America create their own programs like the ones we run._

## Business and Funding

Normally, Iron Reign does not get major funding. However, this year, we have seen our funding,
sponsorships, and grants increase exponentially. Currently, those include:

```
* BigThought - RV materials, staffing, and upkeep
* Dallas City of Learning (DCOL) – RV materials and upkeep
* Advanced Waterjet Cutting – Robot side shields and professional advice
* Best Buy – 4x3D Printers, Laptops for RV
* AmeriCorps – RV staffing
* DISD STEM - $3000 of REV parts and 2 full practice fields
* RoboRealm - $1500 of machine vision software
* Arconic - $
* Dallas Makerspace – Access to machining tools
* DPRG – Robot assistance
* FIRST – Tournament fees
* Texas Workforce Commission – Grant
```
We are always seeking out new sources of funding. In the past, we have applied for prior grants by
sending letters to STEM-curious companies in the Dallas area. For example, we have previously applied
for a $4000 Orix grant, a STEM foundation dedicated to spreading STEM to the underserved. Also,
recently, we received an additional grant from Best Buy for our distinguished service to the
underprivileged within the Dallas area.

In previous years, we have lacked the ability to get significant transportation funding to get to
tournaments. However, through our partnership with DISD, we have solved that problem, and when
DISD is unable to provide transportation due to short notice, we can provide our own transportation due
to our building of the RV.

This year, we went further in finding local businesses by looking up relevant companies that can directly
benefit Iron Reign as mentors and sponsors. So far, one company has come to our aid: Advanced
Waterjet Cutting. We contacted them over the phone and asked about an initial meeting to see if they
would sponsor us for creating side-shields and other specialty parts. They agreed immediately and we
created a mentor partnership that assists us in materials research and design.

Recently, we have designed our own 3D-printed-parts kit, called REVolution. Our intention was to
convert a normal REV bar, as seen on our robot, into a usable driveshaft for design flexibility. Upon
finishing, we went to the REV headquarters and presented our design to them. We also have shared the
basic designs on Thingiverse so that any interested FTC or FRC team can print them out and use it
themselves. **Note: The main REVolution discussion is in the building section.**

## Reference Business Letter

“ Dear Orix,


_Iron Reign Robotics, a robotics team of 8 years, is competing in the 2017/18 First Tech Challenge Velocity
Vortex game. We are based out of the School of Science and Engineering (SEM) in Dallas which is a title
one school._

_The population of the public school is racially diverse and 68 percent of the students are on free-or-
reduced lunch. In spite of our economic challenges, SEM is regularly considered the school that offers
students the most growth in the entire district (highest effectiveness index) and is regularly in the top 10
in many national rankings. But as the second robotics team to be formed at this Dallas ISD Magnet, we
are underfunded by the district and need to reach out to organizations that are investing in the long-
term future of our community._

_Each year we deepen our advanced robotics skills, improve our ability to organize around common team
goals, and learn how to better communicate with technical professionals so that we will prepared make
an impact as we continue through college and eventually join the workforce. Last year our team made it
to the Regional Championship during the FTC season and then proceeded on to the UIL State Robotics
Championship in Austin during the summer. This year, with your support, we are striving to make it to
the 12-state super regional in Georgia and go from there to the World-wide competition in Houston._

_Yet we spend a significant amount of our efforts investing in younger students outside the team. We
work very hard to let young students in North Texas know about the opportunities in STEM education.
We mentor students in elementary and middle schools. We regularly participate in a series of STEM
outreach events to help younger students think of themselves as future scientists, engineers and
technical professionals. This includes presenting at events like the Dallas Mayor’s Back to School Fair,
Earth Day Texas, and Moon day at the Frontiers of Flight Museum just to name a few. Last year
(2015/16) our outreach involvement amounted to 400 team person-hours in service to 2,200 people. We
are unaware of any other FTC team in our region that does as much outreach as we do._

_This year we’ve stepped those numbers up to over 500 person-hours serving over 2,000 people so far just
this summer. This was because we took on a project to renovate an RV to create a mobile learning
laboratory for the Dallas City of Learning. Not only did we turn the interior into a mobile technical
classroom with 3D printers, but many team members volunteered to teach robotics and 3D modelling
and printing on board while volunteering for AmeriCorps with Big Thought this summer. The team was
featured as a “Class Act” on TV channel CW33 because of this effort._

_Unfortunately, time is money and the time it takes us to contribute to each of these events costs us
dollars we don’t have. We all love teaching young children who are interested in robotics and technology
and we hope what they receive is beyond value. But we also need to raise our competitive game and new
parts cost money. When jerry rigging and reusing parts unsuited for the job, we waste time that could be
used to make more progress and continue the advancement of our robot. As we continuously refine our
design, new parts are needed and some need to be replaced as we strive for an efficient and reliable
entry. The other piece of the financial puzzle is transportation costs. This year we plan to take part in
multiple competitions including out-of-state competitions in order to deepen our competitive potential
and improve our chances of advancing to the next level. Competition expenses beyond the standard local
track are some of the hardest expenses to fund._

_We are asking for $4,000 to help us continue our journey into robotics and we hope that Orix can
become a major supporter of our team while we continue to invest in the futures of many more students_


_in North Texas. We would love a chance to visit with you, show you our robot in its current form, and
discover together how much our mission and your focus areas have in common. Please let us know how
to schedule that time. Until then, you can access much more information about Iron Reign on our team

_Warmest Regards,_

Iron Reign “

## Looking Back, Moving Forward

In the past, sustainability has not been a major concern of Iron Reign’s. We’ve essentially had the same
team for seven years. This year, our eighth, we’ve finally lost members through graduation. As a result,
we’ve had to substantially reconsider our approach to recruitment and how to manage our changing
team.

We already have another team in our school, team 3734 Imperial Robotics. **3734 is an entirely different
team, with different sponsors, members, robots, journal, outreach, and codebase.** That being said, we
recruit the more accomplished members of that team. The teams’ relationship is most similar to the
difference between a Junior Varsity team and a Varsity team.

We tend to recruit based on robotics experience, but having robotics experience alone is not a
guarantee of joining our team. Iron Reign has a specific culture, and we tend to recruit people whose
personalities fit our culture. We also do not accept people who only want to join robotics as a resume
booster. While robotics is indeed a resume booster, and we allow every member to claim co-captain on
their college applications, members of Iron Reign ought to join out of their genuine passion for robotics,
not because of it getting them ahead in the rat race of college applications.

Since this year was the first year in which we lost a substantial number of our teammates, we had to
learn how to effectively transfer knowledge. First, we were losing our master of 3D modelling, so we had
two members, learn under his wing throughout last season. Because of that effort, they have now
designed a variety of parts on our robot. For the blog and engineering journal, we had a member learn
under our former head editor’s tutelage how to use Jekyll, Shopify, and manage the blog. This year, we
face difficulties, as we will lose our lead programmer, for next season. To combat this, two members are
learning the intricacies of our codebase, which we’ve kept since we first started using Java.

## Game Strategy

This year, we were faced with a conundrum. The central question was this – “Should we focus on scoring
the cryptoboxes, relic, or jewel?” We settled on the order of Cryptobox > Relic > Jewel.

Our game strategy was based off of the fact that we could build a robot which could score one block
initially, and easily score a column, giving us 40+ points right off the bat. As well, the cryptobox process
is simplistic enough that we could get to the balance stone to gain even more points in the endgame,
without doing any point-risky challenges such as the Relic.


When we finish the cryptobox designs and autonomous, our next goal is the Jewel. The Jewel challenge
is simplistic enough that it could be done in 1-2 meetings without interfering with any other design
processes. Our current planned design process is first to create an arm with a color sensor attached like
most teams, but eventually we plan to remove that color sensor and identify the Jewel only by OpenCV.

Finally, our last area of focus is scoring the Relic. Scoring the Relic involves a high degree of difficulty,
and the risk grows when you consider that you have to score the Relic upright in order to gain the most
points. As well, building an arm that can score the Relic while still staying within the 18x18x18 size limits
increases the design difficulty of the robot.

## Building

This year, Iron Reign has drastically changed how it builds its parts. In previous years, we have relied on
primary Tetrix parts, utilizing AndyMark parts for the drivetrain and other moving areas. However, we
happened to gain access to a motherlode of REV parts, which drastically changes our designs from
previous years.

The biggest change enabling innovation is our newfound use of REV rails within our robot. REV rails
allow for basically unlimited mount points for parts so that we are afforded maximum flexibility in our
designs, comparable to the flexibility of 3D printing.

As well, for this year’s robot chassis, we have decided to take the use of REV parts even further, and use
the REV Power Distribution Module and both Expansion Hubs. The reason for this change is twofold.
First, we experienced significant connection and static issues last year with our robot, partially due to
excess static buildup from our mecanum wheels. So far, we have not experienced any of those issues
using REV modules, even though we are using the same base chassis. Second, the REV hubs allow us to
add more features on to our robot, such as LED strips and extra servos that allow us to signal our team
as well as create more innovative components of our robot.

We also utilize a variety of 3D printed parts on our robot. While we use less 3D printed parts than
previous years that is due to the particular challenges of this year. Our parts are modelled in PTC Creo,
which we obtained for free through an FTC program, and we have recently switched over from Creo V.
to Creo V.4 so that we can use the more advanced features included in the new program. Our personal
3D printer can handle a variety of materials, and we have used nylon, ABS, Filoflex, and Ninjaflex in prior
designs to fit various needs. In our current robot, we have settled on using nylon. Nylon has four
qualities that make it more advantageous than other materials. First, nylon is less brittle and prone to
breaking than materials such as ABS. Second, nylon achieves comparatively high print quality on our
robot as compared to Filoflex and Ninjaflex. Third, nylon has enough give so that it doesn’t break, but is
strong enough to withstand the forces felt in everyday use of our robot. Finally, nylon can be dyed so
that we can give our parts a distinguishing color, a quality that we have taken advantage of in prior
seasons. As our season has progressed, we have taken a look back at various materials, and decided to
consider various features of materials that we have previously neglected. In the picking up of the blocks,
we needed a material that has a higher coefficient of friction than nylon, and settled on NinjaFlex to do
so through a process of trial and error.

An example of these 3D printed parts are our wheel guards. In testing, our mecanum drive train tended
to cut up the cryptoboxes when we drove up against them. As a result, we designed various wheel


guards and tested them. We also made mockups with various materials such as cardboard, to minimize
design time and waste parts. We settled on a U-shaped design to prevent damage to the boxes and
other field elements, while not sacrificing mobility. Then, to guarantee nothing went wrong, we iterated
through various heights of the U-shape so that they would not cut into the mats or bump into other
robots.

Iron Reign’s pinnacle of design and building so far this year is our REVolution system. We were sick of
stripping set screws and twisting axles, and wanted something dependable that also was reusable. Thus
came the REVolution system, the purpose of which was to turn REV extrusions into driveshafts so that
we could have a solid base and more adaptability in our robot. To these ends, we created a library of
parts: mounts, bearing holders, and connectors so that we could use extrusions to do almost anything
on our robot. Attached in our engineering journal is a complete list of parts with names, descriptions,
and pictures.

## Programming

Iron Reign has generated a substantial codebase over the years. Initially, Iron Reign programmed in
RobotC. However, when robot phones started becoming the main form of control, we transferred our
codebase into Java. We use the Android Studio IDE to code our robot.

Our most notable programming achievement has been the integration of machine vision and
augmented reality libraries into our code. Currently, we use Vuforia in conjunction with OpenCV to
identify and score field elements in autonomous, as well as assist in scoring elements during TeleOp.
Both Vuforia and OpenCV are industrial-level technologies that we have integrated into our codebase.
Vuforia, in particular, is currently owned by PTC, one of the sponsors of FIRST.

Another notable programming achievement is our Pose class. We use the class to determine our robot’s
current position on the field using trigonometric functions. While this class currently need updating for
the new season, it can still be used for any small-scale operations on the field.

## Design Process

Iron Reign uses two design processes in conjunction with each other to create efficient and reliable
parts. First, we use the Kaizen design process, also used in industrial corporations such as Toyota. The
philosophy behind Kaizen is the idea of continual improvement, that there is always some modification
to each system on our robot that will make it more efficient or more reliable. As well, design
competitions are a focal point of Iron Reign’s design process. In these design competitions, team
members choose their favored designs that all complete some field challenge, and build them
individually. Upon completion of each mechanism, the designs are tested against each other,
considering weight, maneuverability, reliability, and efficiency.

An example of these design processes working in conjunction is the process of designing our cryptobox
intake system. One person had the idea to build an arm-style grabber seen on many current competition
robots. His design, however, included shorter arms for space’s sake and a more compact lift system than
normal. The second person decided to build a unique conveyor-belt system which used friction to hold
blocks in space and move them vertically. Through the competition, we determined that the prior design
was more efficient and took up less space than the latter, so we settled on his design, adding in a linear


slide for lifting at the end of the process. Then, Kaizen comes in. Through firsthand experience in
scrimmages, we learned that the grabber system isn’t as reliable as we thought when first testing. So,
we have designed a new grabber system that moves like the arms did previously, but also rotate with
soft spikes attached to hold blocks with friction better without damaging them.

As this soft-spike system ceased to perform to our expectations, we looked to other mechanisms to pick
up and deliver blocks effectively. We created a new grabber that still used the rotating systems of the
soft-spike, but instead, we used custom 3D printed “octopuckers” which had a much tighter grip on the
glyphs. As well, inside the gripper, we created a custom “lift” made out of NinjaFlex so that the blocks
could be moved up and down internally in the gripper, eliminating our need for stacking.

Later, we further improved upon the grabber design, attaching it to a conveyor belt so that we could
move glyphs all across our robot in order to score higher, using our REVolution system. This is the most
ambitious use of our REVolution system yet, and we strongly encourage the reading judges to view it at
the pits.
